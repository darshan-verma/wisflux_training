1. **Explain as much as you know about objects in javascript? (A long answer expected).**

    Objects in JavaScript are a fundamental and versatile data structure that serve as the building blocks for modern JavaScript applications. They allow you to model real-world entities, encapsulate related data and behavior, and enable powerful patterns like inheritance and polymorphism. Below is an in-depth explanation of various facets of objects in JavaScript:

    **1. Basic Structure and Creation**

    -Object Literals::
    The simplest way to create an object is using literal notation:
    ```js
    const person = {
      name: "Alice",
      age: 30,
      greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
      }
    };
    ```

    -Constructor Functions and Classes:
Objects can also be created using constructor functions or the ES6 class syntax for a more structured approach:
    ```js
    function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
        }
        Person.prototype.greet = function() {
          console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
        };
        const bob = new Person("Bob", 25);

        // Using ES6 class
        class PersonClass {
          constructor(name, age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
         }
         greet() {
            console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
          }
        }
        const carol = new PersonClass("Carol", 28);
    ```

**2. Properties and Methods**

Properties:
Objects hold data in properties. These properties can be numbers, strings, arrays, or even other objects.

Methods:
Functions attached as properties are called methods. They allow objects to exhibit behavior and interact with their own properties using the this keyword.

**3. Inheritance and Prototypes**

JavaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance system. Every object has a hidden property called [[Prototype]] (accessible via Object.getPrototypeOf or the __proto__ property) which points to another object. This chain allows objects to inherit methods and properties from one another. For example, if a method isn’t found on the object, JavaScript will look up the prototype chain until it finds the method or reaches the end of the chain.

**4. Dynamic Nature**

JavaScript objects are highly dynamic. You can:
Add properties:
```js
person.job = "Engineer";
```
Delete properties:
```js
delete person.age;
```
Modify properties:
```js
person.name = "Alice Smith";
```

**5. Use Cases**

Objects are used for a variety of purposes including:

-Data Storage: Group related data (like a user's information) into a single entity.

-Encapsulation: Hide internal details and expose only necessary methods.

-Modules and Namespaces: Organize code and avoid global namespace pollution.

-OOP: Implement object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

In summary, objects in JavaScript are versatile, dynamic data structures that enable developers to model real-world scenarios, organize code effectively, and utilize inheritance through prototypes. Their flexible nature underpins much of modern JavaScript development.

2. **Read the code :**

```js
    // This is an object based vector template
    var vector = {
    _x: 0,
    _y: 0,
        create: function(x,y){
        var obj = Object.create(this);
            obj.setX(x);
            obj.setY(y);
    return obj;
    },
    }
```
Can you make a “class” based alternative to it? Using Javascript OOP features.

```js
class Vector {
  // Constructor with default values for x and y
  constructor(x = 0, y = 0) {
    this.x = x;
    this._y = y;
  }
  setX(x) {
    this.x = x;
  }
  setY(y) {
    this._y = y;
  }
  // Optionally, you can add getters to retrieve the values.
  getX() {
    return this.x;
  }
  getY() {
    return this._y;
  }
  // A method to display the vector as a string
  toString() {
    return `Vector(x: ${this.x}, y: ${this._y})`;
  }
}
```

3. **Do you think javascript is the language of the future?**
JavaScript has grown from a simple scripting language into a versatile and powerful language used both on the client-side and server-side of web development. Its ecosystem is vast, with frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js on the frontend, and Node.js enabling server-side development. The language continues to evolve with regular updates (for example, ES6 and beyond), providing modern features like classes, arrow functions, and modules.

    Reasons for its continued relevance:

    Ubiquity: JavaScript is the only language supported by all modern web browsers, making it indispensable for front-end development.

    Ecosystem and Community: A large community means a wealth of libraries, frameworks, and resources are available, making development faster and easier.

    Versatility: JavaScript’s applicability isn’t limited to web development—it’s also used in mobile app development (using frameworks like React Native), desktop applications (via Electron), and even IoT devices.

    Continuous Evolution: With each new version, JavaScript introduces features that address modern developer needs, ensuring the language remains competitive.

    While no language can be predicted with absolute certainty to dominate forever, the ongoing improvements, community support, and versatile nature of JavaScript strongly suggest that it will continue to be a major player in the future of programming.
